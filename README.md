# StMicroelectonics external tree

This repository contains the ST external tree to customize Buildroot.
It contains small and demo configurations for DK1 and DK2, that use Kernel, U-boot and TFA
from STMicroelectronics.

## Configurations details

* `st_stm32mp157a_dk1_defconfig & st_stm32mp157c_dk2_defconfig`:
  * Skeleton defconfig with only the basics configurations to make a DK2 boot properly.
* `st_stm32mp157a_dk1_demo_defconfig & st_stm32mp157c_dk2_demo_defconfig`:
  * OP-TEE with examples and tests
  * gcano-binaries to provide Opengl
  * Qt5 with examples
  * Use of external devicetrees imported from STM32CubeMX

## Build procedure

This external tree currently depends on our own Buildroot repository because there are few commit added to follow the ST needs.
The aim is to merge these additionnal commits to the mainline Buildroot in order to remove the dependency to our Buildroot repository.  
  
Clone the Buildroot from Bootlin github repository alongside to this repository.  
Move to the Buildroot directory.  
Checkout to the same branch as this repository.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:bootlin/buildroot.git
$ cd buildroot
buildroot/ $ git checkout st/2021.02
```

Configure Buildroot to use the external tree and select the wanted defconfig.

```bash
buildroot/ $ make BR2_EXTERNAL=/path/to/st_external_tree st_stm32mp157c_dk2_defconfig
```

Compile Buildroot as usual

```bash
buildroot/ $ make
```

## Flash & boot the images

### Using SDCard
For the DK1 or the DK2, you simply need to flash the SDcard with the sdcard.img image file.

```bash
buildroot/ $ dd if=output/images/sdcard.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M
```

Then configure the SW1 switch to boot on SDcard and finally poweron the board.

### Using STM32CubeProgrammer
Download the tool on the [ST website](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html "STM32CubeProgrammer tool").  
A tutorial to use this tool on has been written in this [blog post](https://bootlin.com/blog/building-a-linux-system-for-the-stm32mp1-implementing-factory-flashing/ "Factory flashing a STM32").  
Take a look at the [user manual](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/dm00403500-stm32cubeprogrammer-software-description-stmicroelectronics.pdf "STM32CubeProgrammer User Manual") if you want to use GUI interface.  

## Demo image
The demo image has several features enabled, see the list above.
In this paragraph we will show you how to use them.

### Use devicetree generated by STM32CubeMX
You can use the devicetree generated by [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html "STM32CubeMX tool").
This tools allows you to automatize the generation of devicetrees with a easy to use interface.
You can configure the state of each pin of the stm32mp1 component.  
The tool will generate devicetree for Linux, U-Boot and Arm-Trusted-Firmware (ATF).  
You can find two defaults examples for dk1 and dk2 generated by ST32CubeMX in `board/stmicroelectronics/stm32mp157/\*-dts`
To use these devicetree in buildroot you need to change 2 things:
* The Buildroot defconfig. Update the devicetree names and the `BR2_*_CUSTOM_DTS_PATH` configurations, for the Kernel, U-Boot and ATF.
* Update the devicetree name described in the `extlinux.conf` file. This file is located in the overlay.

You might need to modify the post-image.sh script to use other naming of ATF binary.  
Please see the commit _configs/st: support external devicetrees for kernel, U-boot and ATF_ as an example of using devicetree generated by STM32CubeMX.

### Test DSI and HDMI Display
You can test the DSI and the HDMI display with the `modetest` command.  
First you need to find the ids of the display connectors, then show the test image on the dedicated display.

```bash
# modetest -c
...
Connectors:
id      encoder status          name            size (mm)       modes   encoders
32      0       connected       HDMI-A-1        480x270         5       31
  modes:
        index name refresh (Hz) hdisp hss hse htot vdisp vss vse vtot

  modes:

...

# modetest -s 34:480x800
# modetest -s 32:1280x720
``` 

### Qt examples

You can find the Qt examples at this path: `/usr/lib/qt/examples/`  
To use it you first need to load the galcore module.

```bash
# modprobe galcore
# /usr/lib/qt/examples/hellogl2/hellogl2
```

By default it will use HDMI if plugged or DSI otherwise. 
You can select the wanted display by using a KMS/DRM configuration file.  
You can see more information here: https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/embedded-linux.html#eglfs-with-the-eglfs-kms-backend
